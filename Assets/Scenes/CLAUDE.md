# Assets/Scenes/

Unity scenes (.unity files). Scenes are binary-ish YAML — always use Force Text serialization.

## Scenes

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TestTrack.unity` | Primary test scene with flat terrain, vehicle, and camera |
| `OutpostTrack.unity` | Outpost-themed racing track scene |

## Conventions

- **One gameplay scene + additive scenes** for managers, UI, etc.
- **Scene bootstrapper pattern:** A persistent "Boot" scene loads first, then loads gameplay additively
- **Prefabs over scene objects:** Prefer prefab instances for anything reusable
- Never edit the same scene in parallel branches — merge conflicts are painful
